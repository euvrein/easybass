HERE I AM TO WORSHIP
by Hillsong United
Bass Tuning: Standard

[Intro]

Verse 1
Light of the world,
You stepped down into darkness,
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You,
Hope of a life spent with You.

Chorus
So, here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God!
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me!

Verse 2
King of all days,
Oh so highly exalted,
Glorious in Heaven above,
Humbly You came to the earth You created,
All for love's sake became poor.

Chorus
So, here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me!

Bridge
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross!
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross!

Chorus
So, here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me!
